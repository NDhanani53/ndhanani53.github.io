Using data from the Stanford Open Policing Project, I analyze whether Black and White drivers experience different search rates, and how those rates have changed over time. My approach involves querying each city’s data using SQL to summarize annual stop counts, search counts, and calculated search rates by race. I then compare these trends both within and across cities to identify patterns of disparity or improvement over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\n\ncon_traffic <- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname = \"traffic\",\n  host = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_HOST\"),\n  user = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_USER\"),\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_PWD\")\n)\n\nDBI::dbListTables(con_traffic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"ar_little_rock_2020_04_01\"      \"az_gilbert_2020_04_01\"         \n [3] \"az_mesa_2023_01_26\"             \"az_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n [5] \"ca_anaheim_2020_04_01\"          \"ca_bakersfield_2020_04_01\"     \n [7] \"ca_long_beach_2020_04_01\"       \"ca_los_angeles_2020_04_01\"     \n [9] \"ca_oakland_2020_04_01\"          \"ca_san_bernardino_2020_04_01\"  \n[11] \"ca_san_diego_2020_04_01\"        \"ca_san_francisco_2020_04_01\"   \n[13] \"ca_san_jose_2020_04_01\"         \"ca_santa_ana_2020_04_01\"       \n[15] \"ca_statewide_2023_01_26\"        \"ca_stockton_2020_04_01\"        \n[17] \"co_aurora_2023_01_26\"           \"co_denver_2020_04_01\"          \n[19] \"co_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"ct_hartford_2020_04_01\"        \n[21] \"ct_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"fl_saint_petersburg_2020_04_01\"\n[23] \"fl_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"fl_tampa_2020_04_01\"           \n[25] \"ga_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"ia_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[27] \"id_idaho_falls_2020_04_01\"      \"il_chicago_2023_01_26\"         \n[29] \"il_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"in_fort_wayne_2020_04_01\"      \n[31] \"ks_wichita_2023_01_26\"          \"ky_louisville_2023_01_26\"      \n[33] \"ky_owensboro_2020_04_01\"        \"la_new_orleans_2020_04_01\"     \n[35] \"ma_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"md_baltimore_2020_04_01\"       \n[37] \"md_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"mi_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[39] \"mn_saint_paul_2020_04_01\"       \"mo_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[41] \"ms_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"mt_statewide_2023_01_26\"       \n[43] \"nc_charlotte_2020_04_01\"        \"nc_durham_2020_04_01\"          \n[45] \"nc_fayetteville_2020_04_01\"     \"nc_greensboro_2020_04_01\"      \n[47] \"nc_raleigh_2020_04_01\"          \"nc_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[49] \"nc_winston_salem_2020_04_01\"    \"nd_grand_forks_2020_04_01\"     \n[51] \"nd_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"ne_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[53] \"nh_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"nj_camden_2020_04_01\"          \n[55] \"nj_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"nv_henderson_2020_04_01\"       \n[57] \"nv_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"ny_albany_2020_04_01\"          \n[59] \"ny_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"oh_cincinnati_2020_04_01\"      \n[61] \"oh_columbus_2020_04_01\"         \"oh_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[63] \"ok_oklahoma_city_2023_01_26\"    \"ok_tulsa_2020_04_01\"           \n[65] \"or_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"pa_philadelphia_2020_04_01\"    \n[67] \"ri_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"sc_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[69] \"sd_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"tn_nashville_2020_04_01\"       \n[71] \"tn_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"tx_arlington_2020_04_01\"       \n[73] \"tx_austin_2020_04_01\"           \"tx_garland_2020_04_01\"         \n[75] \"tx_houston_2023_01_26\"          \"tx_lubbock_2020_04_01\"         \n[77] \"tx_plano_2020_04_01\"            \"tx_san_antonio_2023_01_26\"     \n[79] \"tx_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"va_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[81] \"vt_burlington_2023_01_26\"       \"vt_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[83] \"wa_seattle_2020_04_01\"          \"wa_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n[85] \"wa_tacoma_2020_04_01\"           \"wi_madison_2023_01_26\"         \n[87] \"wi_statewide_2020_04_01\"        \"wy_statewide_2020_04_01\"       \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sql .cell-code}\nSELECT \n  'Nashville' AS city,\n  subject_race AS race,\n  YEAR(date) AS year,\n  COUNT(*) AS total_stops,\n  SUM(CASE WHEN search_conducted = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS searches,\n  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN search_conducted = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 3) AS search_rate\nFROM tn_nashville_2020_04_01\nWHERE \n  subject_race IN ('black', 'white') AND\n  date IS NOT NULL AND\n  search_conducted IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY subject_race, YEAR(date)\nORDER BY subject_race, YEAR(date);\n```\n\n\n<div class=\"knitsql-table\">\n\n\nTable: Displaying records 1 -

Each line represents the percentage of stops that resulted in a search for each racial group, by year.

The gap between the two groups is visible in most cities and remains relatively stable over time, suggesting a persistent racial disparity in search practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(city, race) |>\n  summarise(total_stops = sum(total_stops)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = city, y = total_stops, fill = race)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Stops by Race and City\",\n       x = \"City\", y = \"Total Stops\", fill = \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SQL_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis bar chart compares the total number of stops for Black and White drivers in each city over the full time period covered by the data. It shows this by having total stops on the y-axis and cities on the x-axis. We can see two bars for each city to show how many times black people were stopped and how many times white people were stopped. While some cities show more stops for White drivers and others for Black drivers, this variation likely reflects differences in each city’s racial demographics rather than disparities in policing alone. It could also be attributed to having some incomplete or less data in some years This plot provides important context for interpreting the search rate data by showing the baseline number of stops per group.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThrough querying traffic stop data across six U.S. cities using SQL, I analyzed how search rates compare between Black and White individuals over multiple years. By combining city-level results into a unified dataset, I was able to observe trends within and across locations, comparing both the rate and total number of searches by race. The analysis revealed that Black drivers consistently experienced higher search rates than White drivers in every city studied. While the magnitude of disparity varied by city and year, the pattern was both persistent and systemic. Interestingly, when comparing the total number of searches, the dominant racial group varied by city—likely reflecting differences in local demographic composition rather than search behavior alone.\n\nCitation:\nPierson, Emma, Camelia Simoiu, Jan Overgoor, Sam Corbett-Davies, Daniel Jenson, Amy Shoemaker, Vignesh Ramachandran, et al. 2020. “A Large-Scale Analysis of Racial Disparities in Police Stops Across the United States.” Nature Human Behaviour, 1–10.\n\n\n\n\n",
