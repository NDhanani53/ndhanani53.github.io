    "text": "Introduction:\nIn today’s media landscape, the New York Times remains one of the most influential news outlets, shaping public discourse on politics and international affairs. To better understand how political topics are covered in NYT headlines, this analysis explores a dataset of article titles, focusing on mentions of key political terms and global locations. By identifying headlines that reference terms like “election,” “president,” or “congress,” and extracting country or region names, we can begin to map out how political attention is distributed across the globe and how it has evolved throughout time. This exploration provides insight into the geographic focus of political reporting, how frequently certain regions appear in headlines, and how this coverage has changed over time. Through a combination of text filtering and location extraction, the following analysis aims to uncover patterns in political narrative emphasis and international visibility in the New York Times.\nExploratory Analysis:\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(RTextTools)\ndata(\"NYTimes\")\n\n\n# Convert date and extract year\nNYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(Date = dmy(Date), Year = year(Date)) |&gt;\n  count(Year) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of NYTimes Articles per Year\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Article Count\",\n    alt = \"The chart displays vertical bars, one for each year. The x-axis lists the years covered in the dataset, and the y-axis shows how many articles were published in each year. Taller bars mean more articles. This lets you easily see which years have more content and whether article volume increased, decreased, or stayed steady over time. The amoutn fo articles stayed consistent around 300 until 2003 where it drops to about 250 articles\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows the number of New York Times articles included in the dataset for each year. It gives an overview of the time span covered by the data and how many articles were published annually. This helps us understand the distribution of article volume over time, which is useful context before filtering or analyzing specific topics like politics or geography.\nVariables:\n\nArticle_ID - A unique numerical identifier for each article in the dataset\nDate - The publication date of the article (usually in day-month-year format)\nTitle - The article headline as it appeared in The New York Times\nSubject - A brief summary or annotation describing the main idea of the article\nTopic.Code - A numeric code representing the article’s assigned policy topic or issue domain\n\n\n# Load the NYTimes data set and convert it to a tibble for easier handling\ndata(NYTimes)\nas_tibble(NYTimes)\n\n# A tibble: 3,104 × 5\n   Article_ID Date      Title                                 Subject Topic.Code\n        &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;                                 &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1      41246 1-Jan-96  Nation's Smaller Jails Struggle To C… Jails …         12\n 2      41257 2-Jan-96  FEDERAL IMPASSE SADDLING STATES WITH… Federa…         20\n 3      41268 3-Jan-96  Long, Costly Prelude Does Little To … Conten…         20\n 4      41279 4-Jan-96  Top Leader of the Bosnian Serbs Now … Bosnia…         19\n 5      41290 5-Jan-96  BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW… Battle…          1\n 6      41302 7-Jan-96  South African Democracy Stumbles on … politi…         19\n 7      41314 8-Jan-96  Among Economists, Little Fear on Def… econom…          1\n 8      41333 10-Jan-96 BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW… budget…          1\n 9      41344 11-Jan-96 High Court Is Cool To Census Change   census…         20\n10      41355 12-Jan-96 TURMOIL AT BARNEYS: THE DIFFICULTIES… barney…         15\n# ℹ 3,094 more rows\n\n\n\n# This chunk filters articles that mention political topics (e.g. \"election\", \"president\", \"congress\") and extracts geographic keywords.

Each bar represents a specific location mentioned in political headlines, based on keywords like “election,” “vote,” “president,” etc. The data has been filtered to include only articles that reference both politics and one of several predefined countries or regions. The color gradient indicates the volume of mentions, making it easier to spot which places dominate the political conversation in NYT headlines.\n\n#In this chunk, we extract the year from each article date and count how many political headlines occurred each year.

By focusing only on political headlines containing specific keywords and country names, this plot visualizes how global political focus in NYT coverage has shifted or intensified over time. Spikes or dips in the line may correspond to key events such as presidential elections, international conflicts, or geopolitical crises.\nCitation:\nBoydstun, A. E. (2013).

Boydstun, a political scientist and professor at the University of California, Davis. She gathered this data as part of her research for the book Making the News: Politics, the Media, and Agenda Setting, which examines patterns in media attention and agenda-setting processes.\nWhy it was collected? The primary aim of collecting this data was to analyze how policy issues gain prominence in media coverage, particularly focusing on the dynamics of news reporting by major outlets like The New York Times. The research sought to understand the factors influencing which issues are highlighted in the news and how this affects public discourse and policy-making.\nOriginal source of the information: The data originates from a systematic content analysis of The New York Times front-page articles spanning from 1996 to 2006. Each article was coded for various attributes, including policy topics, framing, and prominence, to facilitate a comprehensive study of media coverage patterns."
