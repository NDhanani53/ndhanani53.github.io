Introduction:

To explore how player compensation varies across different roles in the NFL, I analyzed a dataset containing salary data by position. Initially, the data was in wide format, with each column representing a different player position. To better visualize and compare the salary distributions across these positions, I reshaped the dataset into a long format using a pivot operation. This allowed me to create a single box plot chart displaying the spread, median, and variability of salaries for each position. The resulting visualization reveals clear disparitiesâ€”most notably, the consistently higher salaries earned by quarterbacks, while positions like special teamer and safeties tend to fall on the lower end of the pay scale. This plot offers an accessible summary of the economic hierarchy within professional football.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

file_path <- "nfl_salary.xlsx"
nfl_salary <- read_excel(file_path)

nfl_long <- nfl_salary |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -year,
    names_to = "position",
    values_to = "salary"
  )

ggplot(nfl_long, aes(x = position, y = salary)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "NFL Salaries by Position", x = "Position", y = "Salary") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

This boxplot shows the distribution of NFL player salaries by position. Each box represents the range of salaries for a given position across multiple players, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. It allows for easy comparison of pay differences between positions, such as the typically higher salaries of quarterbacks compared to special teamers.
